## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-2-max
Model description: The highest fidelity image model from Black Forest Labs


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- input_images (optional): List of input images for image-to-image generation. Maximum 8 images. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (array)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image. Use 'match_input_image' to match the first input image's aspect ratio. (string)
- resolution (optional): Resolution in megapixels. Up to 4 MP is possible, but 2 MP or below is recommended. The maximum image size is 2048x2048, which means that high-resolution images may not respect the resolution if aspect ratio is not 1:1.

Resolution is not used when aspect_ratio is 'custom'. When aspect_ratio is 'match_input_image', use 'match_input_image' to match the input image's resolution (clamped to 0.5-4 MP). (string)
- width (optional): Width of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). (integer)
- height (optional): Height of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). (integer)
- safety_tolerance (optional): Safety tolerance, 1 is most strict and 5 is most permissive (integer)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)

>   Maintain identities, products, and styles across large batches:
>   - Up to **8 reference images** via API  
>   - Up to **10 reference images** in the Playground  
>   Create dozens of ad variants using the same face, consistent product mockups across environments, or dynamic fashion editorials with unwavering identity fidelity.
> 
> - **Our most creative model yet**  
>   Generate multiple images from the same prompt where no two results look alike — while still respecting the prompt. Ideal for ideation, exploration, and creative discovery.
> 
> - **Maximum quality at FLUX speed**  
>   Despite major gains in image quality, editing precision, and prompt adherence, FLUX.2 [max] generates content nearly as fast as FLUX.2 [pro], making it up to **3× faster** than competing models of similar quality.
