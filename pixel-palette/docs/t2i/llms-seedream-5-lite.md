## Basic model info

Model name: bytedance/seedream-5-lite
Model description: Seedream 5.0 lite: image generation with built-in reasoning, example-based editing, and deep domain knowledge


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- image_input (optional): Input image(s) for image-to-image generation. List of 1-14 images for single or multi-reference generation. (array)
- size (optional): Image resolution: 2K (2048px) or 3K (3072px). (string)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Image aspect ratio. Use 'match_input_image' to automatically match the input image's aspect ratio. (string)
- sequential_image_generation (optional): Group image generation mode. 'disabled' generates a single image. 'auto' lets the model decide whether to generate multiple related images (e.g., story scenes, character variations). (string)
- max_images (optional): Maximum number of images to generate when sequential_image_generation='auto'. Range: 1-15. Total images (input + generated) cannot exceed 15. (integer)
- output_format (optional): Output image format. (string)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri"
  },
  "title": "Output"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.


## Example inputs and outputs

Use these example outputs to better understand the types of inputs the model accepts, and the types of outputs the model returns:

Her hair is pulled back severely, face serene, skin porcelain. A single monarch butterfly rests on her shoulder. The background is a soft impressionist blur of green hedgerows and pale sky.

## Model readme

> # Seedream 5.0 lite
> 
> Seedream 5.0 lite is ByteDance's latest image generation model. It goes beyond standard text-to-image by adding multi-step reasoning, example-based editing, and deep domain knowledge to the generation process.
> 
> ## What's new in 5.0
> 
> ### Example-based editing
> Instead of describing a complex edit in words, show the model what you want. Give it a before/after pair, then a new image — the model figures out what changed and applies the same transformation. This works for material swaps, style transfers, scene changes, and more.
> 
> ### Logical reasoning
> Seedream 5.0 reasons through spatial relationships, physics, and processes. Ask it to put objects on a seesaw with correct weight distribution, draw a clock with hands in the right positions, or illustrate a metamorphosis across life stages — it gets the details right.
> 
> ### Deep domain knowledge
> The model understands professional conventions across architecture, science, health, and design. Feed it a floor plan sketch and get a photorealistic interior rendering. Ask for a scientific cross-section diagram and get labeled, accurate illustrations.
> 
> ## Features
> 
> - **Text-to-image**: Generate images from text prompts with strong aesthetic quality
> - **Image-to-image**: Edit existing images using natural language instructions
> - **Multi-image blending**: Combine up to 14 reference images with text to create new compositions
> - **Sequential batch generation**: Generate sets of related images (storyboards, brand identity packages, character sheets) in one request
> - **Text rendering**: Accurate typography with support for multiple languages — wrap text in double quotes for best results
> - **Output format**: PNG or JPEG output
> 
> ## Resolutions
> 
> - **2K**: Up to 2048px base dimension
> - **3K**: Up to 3072px base dimension
> 
> Supported aspect ratios: 1:1, 4:3, 3:4, 16:9, 9:16, 3:2, 2:3, 21:9
> 
> ## Prompting tips
> 
> 1. **Use natural language, not keyword lists.** "A girl in a lavish dress walking under a parasol along a tree-lined path, in the style of a Monet oil painting" works better than "girl, umbrella, tree-lined street, oil painting texture."
> 2. **Use double quotes for text rendering.** If you want specific text in your image, wrap it in double quotation marks.
> 3. **Be specific about what to keep.** When editing, tell the model what shouldn't change: "Replace the hat with a crown, keeping the pose and expression unchanged."
> 4. **For example-based editing, show don't tell.** When the transformation is hard to describe in words, provide a before/after example pair as input images.
> 5. **Specify your use case.** Telling the model "Design a logo for a gaming company" gives better results than just describing the visual elements.
> 
> ## API quickstart
> 
> ```python
> import replicate
> 
> output = replicate.run(
>     "bytedance/seedream-5",
>     input={
>         "prompt": "A color film-inspired portrait with shallow depth of field, fine grain suggesting high ISO film stock, candid documentary style",
>         "size": "2K",
>         "aspect_ratio": "3:2",
>     }
> )
> 
> print(output)
> ```
> 
> ### With image input
> 
> ```python
> output = replicate.run(
>     "bytedance/seedream-5",
>     input={
>         "prompt": "Transform the color grading to match a Wong Kar-wai film — saturated teal shadows, warm amber highlights, soft diffusion",
>         "image_input": ["https://example.com/portrait.jpg"],
>         "size": "2K",
>     }
> )
> ```
> 
> ### Batch generation
> 
> ```python
> output = replicate.run(
>     "bytedance/seedream-5",
>     input={
>         "prompt": "A series of 4 coherent illustrations of a courtyard across the four seasons",
>         "sequential_image_generation": "auto",
>         "max_images": 4,
>     }
> )
